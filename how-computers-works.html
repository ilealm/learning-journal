    <h1>How Computers Works (Read 06b)</h1>
   
        <h3>This are a new thing I learned about the video:</h3>

    <h3 style="color: aqua;">What's make a computer a computer?</h3>
    <i>
        Is a device created to help us in the thinking work, to <b>maniputale information</b>, doing 4 task:
        <ol>    
            <li>Take input: Receive information, instructions, commands from user.</li>
            <li>Store information: This are done in the memory of the computer</li>
            <li>Process stored information: Take information from memory and procceded by 
                algorits, which are series of commands. This process continuos inteac with the stored information.</li>
            <li>Output the results: Gives the user the result of the commands indicated in the algorits.</li>
        </ol>
        This devices had evolved since making basic math operations to today technology, but stil have 4 basic elements: 
        <b>Memony, CPU, Input and Output.</b>
    </i>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: aqua;">How information is represented?</h3>
        <i>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Information inside the computer are represented in cero and one: (on / off) (true or false). 
                </li>
                <li>This is called electro signals.</li>
                <li>This signal is called "bit".</li>
                <li>This way of working created the "Binary system", where any nunmber can be represented.</li>
                <li>All information can be represented in numbers: text, images, video.</li>
            </ul>
        <i>
    
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: aqua;">How computers use circuits?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>circuits are considered the "back bone" of the computers</li>
            <li> This is done using electricity </li>
            <li>Used to maniputale the bits by wires, the more wires, more information to store and maniputale.</li>
            <li>The circuits are puted together to create bigers numbers.</li>
            <li>All the operations done by computres, are a series of long math process.</li>
            <li>The smaller the circuits, the smaller the electrical signal have to go, which translate in velocity in the computer.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>   
     <h3 style="color: aqua;">The 4 parts of the computer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> This is done using electricity </li>
            <li>Used to maniputale the bits by wires, the more wires, more information to store and maniputale.</li>
            <li>The circuits are puted together to create bigers numbers.</li>
            <li>All the operations done by computres, are a series of long math process.</li>
            <li>The smaller the circuits, the smaller the electrical signal have to go, which translate in velocity in the computer.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <br>   
     <h3 style="color: aqua;">What is software?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Are the computer programs or code, running in the machine.</li>
            <li>The CPU is the main controler of the computer's elements</li>
            <li>Administrate the circuit's work</li>
        </ul>
