## This is a Layout quick review

_When we create a new page, site or app, we should ask ourselves at least some of the next questions:_


* Whom are the target audiences.
* Which are the motivations from out target audiences.
* Which are their goals / needs.
* Which are the most importan features.
* Which is the service / goods of the site.
* Audiences characteristics: income, ubication, gender, age...

We **_have to think_** very hard in this questions, because our site display should be focus on our target audiences.

Clean pages always are better than piled up information, and without logic arrangement and flow.

## A bad disign can lead a site failure, so never understimate layout design.

There are a bunch of useful code elements that can help to build and organized and clean great site, such as divs, paragraphs, tables, list, sections and so on, **_but the design will be the core of the engaging with the users._**
