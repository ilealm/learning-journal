Why a text editor?
For develop a page, we need a text editor

Chose a text editor is hard. And is really important! A bad choice can be reflected in a lot of waste time, effort and frustration.

If the one you selected can build a complete site and be confortable while doing it, then that’s the one.  This one should have:
 
Code completion (Really importan!)
Syntax highlighting
Variety of themes 
Ability to choose from selection of extensions 

As nice feature that the editor could have, are shorthand language. One of it is Emmet, which allows to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. Another very useful feature is syntax highlighting, which makes easier to look for an error. Themes is another feature you won´t want to miss, which allow the developer to change the color of the background of the text editor, the series of colors in the text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of the text editing software as well.

There is a way to empower your text editor: Extensions. These are like plugins for your text editor, that allows the developer to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need it.



Examples of text editors that come with the computer:

Text Edit
Notepad
Gedit

These text editor examples, indeed works and can create an .html, .css etc code, but they do not offer the benefits of specialized code editors. This is one of the main reasons to download a specialized code editor.

Examples of text editors that can download to the computer:
Notepad++
Text Wrangler 
BB Edit
Visual Studio Code
Atom, Brackets
Sublime Text


So, the way to find a great text editor is to try them. Pick a few that you feels that is right for you, and test it.

Enjoy coding!



That weird thing called command 

The command line, or terminal, is a text-based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. It displays as a new window in your computer.

To open one in Mac, follow these steps:
Find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. 

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. 

Some examples of how to interact with the terminal are:

pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. Tells you what your current or present working directory is.
Ls: It's short for list: plain listing of our current location.
Cd: Move around in the system we use a command called cd which stands for change directory



Documents are organized in paths. There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths. To begin with, we have to understand that the file system under linux is a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the structure is what's called the root directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories. Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ) Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
