# Mindset

*For me, the concept of mindset is*

1. Realize that somehow, we have a pin set on us with some untruth tag.
1. We have the power to remove from us that tag.
1. We are remove that pin/tag from our mind.
1. We replace it with a new positive thought.


*For example, I would like to give this examples:*

When I enrolled in this course, and I saw that the passing grade is 90, I freaked out, *I got really worried and doubt in my capacities #but then, I remembered that I already did this kind of staff, I just go to try# and do my best*, and everthing will be great.
