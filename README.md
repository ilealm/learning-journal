# Mindset

## *For me, the concept of mindset is*

1. Realize that somehow, we have a pin set on us with some untruth tag.
1. We have the power to remove from us that tag.
1. We are remove that pin/tag from our mind.
1. We replace it with a new positive thought.


##*For example, I would like to give this examples:*

When I enrolled in this course, and I saw that the passing grade is 90, I freaked out, **_I got really worried and doubt in my capacities # but then, I remembered that I already did this kind of staff, I just go to try # and do my best_**, and everthing will be great.

Another example is when someone told me "you cannot do by job". After a series of feelings, I have to remember that **_not because someone said something about my capacities, are necessary true_**.

Al one more example in my life was to change the setup of "you should not run because you have asthma". I have to change that programmation in me to think **_"IÂ´m going to try it, little by little, giving attention to by body"_**.
